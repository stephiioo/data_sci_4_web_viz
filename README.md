## difficulties: 

### - for some reason cloud shell was not letting me push into github so i had to do a lot of troubleshooting to get it to work.

### - after deploying the shiny link, it kept loading but not populating and i am not sure if it was an issue with my wifi or something else so I attached an image of the app after it ran as proof
